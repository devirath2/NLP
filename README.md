IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and News Article Classification
 1. Overview
 Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining
 whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, we will
 analyze movie reviews from the IMDb dataset and predict the sentiment (positive or
 negative) based on the text of the reviews. By leveraging various text preprocessing
 techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms, this project will
 develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of movie
 reviews. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for movie producers, critics,
 and platforms like IMDb to understand public opinion and tailor marketing or content
 strategies accordingly.
 2. Problem Statement
 The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that
 can predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews. The dataset contains a collection of movie
 reviews, and each review is labeled as either positive or negative.
 Using text preprocessing, feature extraction techniques (such as TF-IDF), and various
 classification algorithms, the project will aim to develop a model that can effectively classify
 the sentiment of movie reviews. The model's performance will be evaluated using standard
 classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# News Article Classification
 1. Overview
 In today’s digital world, news articles are constantly being generated and shared across
 different platforms. For news organizations, social media platforms, and aggregators,
 classifying articles into specific categories such as sports, politics, and technology can help
 improve content management and recommendation systems. This project aims to develop a
 machine learning model that can classify news articles into predefined categories, such as
 sports, politics, and technology, based on their content.
 By automating this process, organizations can efficiently categorize large volumes of news
 articles, making it easier for readers to access relevant information based on their interests.
 2. Problem Statement
 The primary objective of this project is to build a classification model that can automatically
 categorize news articles into different predefined categories. The model will be trained using
 a labeled dataset of news articles and will output the most likely category (e.g., sports,
 politics, or technology) for any given article.
 The goal is to:
 ● Develop a robust classifier capable of handling articles from multiple categories.
 ● Preprocess the text data, extract meaningful features, and train models to classify the
 articles.
 ● Evaluate the model performance and provide actionable insights on how well it
 classifies articles.
