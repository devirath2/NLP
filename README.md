IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and News Article Classification
 1. Overview
 Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining
 whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, we will
 analyze movie reviews from the IMDb dataset and predict the sentiment (positive or
 negative) based on the text of the reviews. By leveraging various text preprocessing
 techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms, this project will
 develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of movie
 reviews. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for movie producers, critics,
 and platforms like IMDb to understand public opinion and tailor marketing or content
 strategies accordingly.
 2. Problem Statement
 The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that
 can predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews. The dataset contains a collection of movie
 reviews, and each review is labeled as either positive or negative.
 Using text preprocessing, feature extraction techniques (such as TF-IDF), and various
 classification algorithms, the project will aim to develop a model that can effectively classify
 the sentiment of movie reviews. The model's performance will be evaluated using standard
 classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
